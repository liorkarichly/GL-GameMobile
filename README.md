# GL - Game Mobile

## A console games information application for android mobile, implemented and designed in Android Studio, with Java and developed in RESTful API. Our app relies on Rawg.io API database that contains 0.5 million console games, and Google Maps API for an easy location service for gaming stores in the vicinity. In short the app allows the user to search console games by name or by chosen filters and get all the relevant information about them or browse recommended games that are refreshed daily.
