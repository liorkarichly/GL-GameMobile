# GL - Game Mobile

## A console games information application for android mobile, implemented and designed in Android Studio, with Java
   and developed in RESTful API. Our app relies on Rawg.io API database that contains 0.5 million console games, and
   Google Maps API for an easy location service for gaming stores in the vicinity. In short the app allows the user to
   search console games by name or by chosen filters and get all the relevant information about them or browse
   recommended games that are refreshed daily.
